Big Beacon Manifesto
====================

People of Earth...
We live on a planet of nearly 7 billion
people, and the growing impacts of
technology on our lives—both positive
and negative—become more obvious
with each passing year. Powerful
forces have been unleashed that are
changing the way we communicate,
the way we learn, the way we think,
and how and where we work.
Concern about the
consequences and
sustainability of our
old-school style
problem-solving
approaches
is rising.
In the coming years,
much of the excitement of finding ways to help
others and make a difference will come from
(one)
the mastery and marshalling of technology in service
to people through new products, new services, new
markets, new institutions, new situations, new places
plus
(two)
doing so with a heightened sensitivity to and
understanding of human values, intentions,
behaviors, and consequences.
These opportunities are
everywhere around us.
They appeal to a broad spectrum of the
curious, the adventurous, and the public-
spirited of the next generation. They excite
the next Steve Jobs and Max Levchin, the
next great tech entrepreneur. They appeal
to the next Bill Drayton and Emily Pilloton,
the next impactful social entrepreneur.  
These opportunities resonate with those who would join
Engineers Without Borders, for example, to bring reliable clean
water supplies to villages in Central Africa.
They energize those who desire to create the next app, gizmo,
process or system that we simply cannot live without.
These aspirations are authentic and meaningful, and many
would like to pursue them.
They naturally lead to seeking an education in engineering,
computer science, or some other technologically related field. 
But those who come to school in
search of the excitement of
creating cutting edge technology
or helping people through
engineering find something else.
They find an educational system
stuck in a rut,
a rut not of the 1990s or 1980s,
but a rut of the 1950s.
In the era of the internet and the tablet computer,
those who wish to be educated
in order to change a technological world
find an education system developed during
the heyday of manual switchboards
and Hollerith keypunches.
In a world of collaboration and teamwork,
they find schools with individuals learning alone.
In a world of cool product and service design,
sensitivity to the voice of the customer,
and attention to the needs of those in the developing world,
they find a math-science death march and rigid curricula,
taught in impersonal lecture halls,
with an emphasis on one right (largely technical) answer.  
The practicing engineer trained in this system
survived its excesses,
but he or she knows intimately how outdated it is.
The practicing engineer today has w
itnessed a
world shifting beneath his or her own education, a
world in which more technological change has taken
place recently than in all of prior human history.
These practitioners love their chosen profession and
w an education for today’s young person that
ish
shares the joy and passion today’s practicing
engineer found only after graduation.  
Some courageous educators
strive to overcome this educational rut, but inertia, culture, and
bureaucracy inside colleges and universities around the world
keep the old system in place. However, it no longer serves the
students it attempts to educate, the parents or governments
who pay the bills, the employers who hire the students, or the
society that uses the services the employer provides.
These courageous educators
serve students at substantial risk to themselves and their
careers, and they deserve support, but often their efforts are
isolated and, as such, unsustainable.
The system needs to change,
but the status quo
steadfastly resists effective transformation,
and change efforts to date have been
inadequate, ineffective, or both. 
The status quo will not go easily,
but go it must. 
The technological forces changing our world have illuminated
a new path, a path leading to a whole new engineer,
an engineer appropriate to our time and the foreseeable
future, appropriate to the eager young people of our world,
appropriate to those who wish to join the excitement of our
times actively, directly, wholeheartedly, and now.
Therefore, we come together,
in the light of growing awareness and heightened urgency,
and shine a big beacon upon needed change. 
Here’s our
big beacon
manifesto
to shine
that light.
We recognize that engineers are not
left-brained equation solvers working in isolation
from human needs,
challenges, and opportunities.
Engineers are whole-brained,
whole-bodied human beings
—whole new engineers—
who come fully assembled,
ready for some of the most important
collaborative action of our times. 
The whole new engineer
1. Finds joy in
engineering
and in life.
The whole new engineer
2. is open,
trusted,
and trusting.
The whole new engineer
3. is authentically
connected
with others.
The whole new engineer
4. is powerfully
present to
possibilities in the
moment.
The whole new engineer
5. is mindful,
observant, and an
effective listener.
The whole new engineer
6. has the courage to
initiate, fail, and
initiate again.
The whole new engineer
7. is technically
competent
and agile.
The whole new engineer
8. is broadly
educated and
curious.
The whole new engineer
9. is a team player, a
collaborator, and a
community builder.
The whole new engineer
10. is a designer,
a creator, and
a sustainer.
The whole new engineer
11. is emotionally and
socially aware and
competent.
The whole new engineer
12. is a reflective
thinker and
a self-directed
and persistent
learner.
Engineering education is not a
mind-numbing math-science
death march that casts aside thousands of
capable young people who might otherwise
have made effective engineers.
It is a joyful, trusting process
that delights in serving student aspirations,
learning, and growth, unleashing the
potential of each individual.
A whole new
engineering education
13. is a joyful and
challenging
experience.
.
A whole new
engineering education
14. trusts students,
believing they are
resourceful,
creative,
and whole.
.
A whole new
engineering education
15. connects with
students by
fostering a sense of
community.
.
A whole new
engineering education
16. encourages
diverse student
aspirations and
increases student
autonomy and
choice.
.
A whole new
engineering education
17. accommodates
diverse
learning styles.
.
A whole new
engineering education
18. fosters agile
technical
competence in a
changing world.
.
A whole new
engineering education
19. fosters concern
for human values
and ethics.
.
A whole new
engineering education
20. encourages
pervasive
collaboration and
teamwork.
.
A whole new
engineering education
21. celebrates action
in the world and
values failure that
results in learning.
.
A whole new
engineering education
22. values educators
who are
servant teachers.
.
A whole new
engineering education
23. listens to and
collaborates with all
stakeholders
.
A whole new
engineering education
24. walks the talk of
the whole
new engineer.
.
Effective educational change
(educational rewire) is not
(1) a class-by-class process of content or
pedagogical reform,
or
(2) something that awaits new research.
It is an emotional and cultural process
using known methods in a way that
practically, systematically, and sustainably
promotes the dual vision of the
whole new engineer and a whole new e
engineering education.
Educational rewire
25. questions, listens,
and is mindfully
present to the
possibilities of
effective action.
Educational rewire
26. engages the
willing, and
embraces the once
unwilling as soon as
they are open to
change.
Educational rewire
27. uses exemplars of
authentic student
engagement to
change hearts then
minds.
Educational rewire
28. is a personal,
emotional, and
cultural process that
depends upon
changing language
and story.
Educational rewire
29. Uses incubators
and pilots to permit
innovation and
respect faculty
governance .
Educational rewire
30. is a process of
open innovation that
collaboratively
disrupts
the status quo.
Educational rewire
31. unleashes
students in service
to their education,
and unleashes
teachers in service
to students.
Big Beacon
is a movement,
shining
a light on
needed
change.
Big Beacon
is empowering people
to come together,
points of light near and
far, large and small, to
shine a collective beam
seen around the world.
 Acting together,
we are more powerful than those who
would act alone.
Acting together,
we collaboratively disrupt a system that
has defied change for many years.
 Acting together,
we illuminate culture and emotion and
pathways to effective change, cutting
through the fog of a broken system. Beam
by sweeping beam, the fog lifts. In the
clearing daylight, together we unleash a
whole new engineering education and
we bring forth generations of
whole new engineers
to the benefit of
the people of Earth.
