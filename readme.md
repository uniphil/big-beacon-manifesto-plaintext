big-beacon-manifesto-plaintext
==============================

A quick manual conversion of the big beacon manifesto from its flashy pdf to a
more readable plain-text version.

The document was converted after I (uniphil) attended a session on Global
Engineering at the [Engineers Without Borders](http://ewb.ca) [National
Conference 2014](http://conference2014.ewb.ca) hosted by Dave Goldburg. We used
it in the session, but I found it hard to parse in its flashy PDF form.

The PDF was downloaded from [bigbeacon.org](http://bigbeacon.org/) ([direct
link](http://bigbeacon.org/big-beacon-manifesto.pdf)).

The paragraph, syntactic, and (where necessary or practical) rhetorical
structure has undergone some changes in the interest of readability. I tried to
keep all changes in the spirit of the original, but please refer to the PDF in
this repo as the official and correct source for the plain text version of the
manifesto, and the direct link above for the most up-to-date content.
